# Redact

**Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome utility to redact parts of CQU web pages for student privacy such as during live demos**

The utility is specifically for CQUniversity systems including [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), EASICONNECT and AIMS. It will hide personal details of students during live demonstrations or screencast recordings.  The utility is incomplete so test your pages before your presentation.

If you are looking to customise Redact for your own requirements, [a more generic branch](https://github.com/damoclark/Redact) is available in this repository. 

## Installation and Usage

There are separate instructions for:
- [Mozilla Firefox](Firefox-Installation-Instructions.md "Firefox Installation Instructions")
- [Google Chrome](Chrome-Installation-Instructions.md "Google Chrome Installation Instructions")
